# Overview

This is a very pretty display of particle generation through three.js! It uses a debug menu with many options, and I've included a personal
touch in the debug menu with the ability to change the color of the particles, and to group these options by type.

# Three.js Journey
This code is a part of a lesson in the Three.JS Journey, which has been lightly modified to include some of my personal changes and menus.
All included code is owned by Three.JS Journey.
